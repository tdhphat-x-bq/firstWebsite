        <h4>Cryptography</h4>
        <p>A key element of blockchain technology is cryptography. By ensuring that the intended receiver may only see a message's contents, it safeguards sensitive information.</p>
        <h4>Databases and Networking</h4>
        <p>A blockchain developer is responsible for developing and maintaining a blockchain network. To do this, they must have a strong understanding of databases and networking.<br><br>
         Databases are necessary for storing the data that makes up a blockchain. This data includes the transactions that have taken place on the blockchain, as well as the information needed to verify those transactions. Without a database, it would be impossible to keep track of all the data that makes up a blockchain.
Networking is also essential for a blockchain developer. Developers must be able to connect different computers and devices to create a blockchain network. It allows the different nodes on a blockchain network to communicate with each other and share data. Without networking, it would be impossible to create a blockchain.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Structure</h4>
        <p>A blockchain developer is responsible for developing and maintaining a blockchain platform. They must have a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as a solid grounding in cryptography. In addition, they must be able to develop smart contracts and be familiar with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.</p>
        <h4>Blockchain Architecture</h4>
        <p>In general, blockchain architecture is composed of three elements. They are:

            Blocks - Blocks are groups of transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.
            Transactions - Transactions are digital signatures of the participants in the transactions.
            Nodes - Nodes are computers that participate in the network and validate the transactions.
            These are some must-have skills to be a blockchain developer. You can become a <a href="https://www.knowledgehut.com/blockchain/blockchain-solutions-architect-certification-training"> certified Blockchain Solution Architect </a> by acquiring and developing the relevant skills.</p>
